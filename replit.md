## Recent Changes

### October 03, 2025 - Unified Referral Statistics API Endpoint

#### Consolidated Referral Statistics with Flexible Filtering
- **API Simplification**: Merged two separate referral endpoints into a single, filterable endpoint
- **Unified Endpoint**: `/api/v1/clients/referral-stats/` now handles all referral statistics with query parameters
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `scope`: `all` (default) - includes all referrals, or `with_reservations` - only referrals who made reservations
  - `order_by`: `total_referrals` (default) or `referrals_with_reservations`
  - `limit`: number of results in top_rankings (default: 10)
- **Removed Endpoint**: Deprecated `/api/v1/clients/referral-stats/with-reservations/` (functionality now available via `?scope=with_reservations`)
- **Direct Database Queries**: Uses live ORM queries instead of relying on ReferralRanking model for real-time statistics
- **Enhanced Response**: Includes position/ranking numbers, scope identification, and configurable result limits
- **Examples**: 
  - `GET /api/v1/clients/referral-stats/` - All referrals ranked by total count
  - `GET /api/v1/clients/referral-stats/?scope=with_reservations` - Only referrals with reservations
  - `GET /api/v1/clients/referral-stats/?order_by=referrals_with_reservations&limit=20` - Top 20 by reservation count
- **Bug Fix**: Corrected total_referrals calculation to use actual count instead of annotated field

### October 01, 2025 - Specific Weekday Discount Functionality

#### Enhanced Discount System with Specific Day Selection
- **New Feature**: Added ability to configure discounts for specific days of the week (e.g., "Fridays only", "Fridays and Saturdays")
- **Database Schema**: New `specific_weekdays` field in `AutomaticDiscount` model stores comma-separated weekday numbers (0=Mon, 4=Fri, 6=Sun)
- **Priority Logic**: Specific weekdays take precedence over `restrict_weekdays` and `restrict_weekends` settings
- **Validation**: Comprehensive day validation in both `applies_to_client()` and `applies_to_client_global()` methods
- **Admin Interface**: Updated with user-friendly weekday display showing configured days (e.g., "ðŸ“Œ Vie, SÃ¡b")
- **Migration**: Created migration 0042 for `specific_weekdays` field
- **Examples**: 
  - "4" = Fridays only
  - "4,5" = Fridays and Saturdays
  - "0,1,2,3,4" = Weekdays (Monday-Friday)
- **Use Cases**: Flash sales on specific days, weekend promotions, mid-week discounts

- **Admin Interface**: Evidence preview and approval workflow
- **API Endpoints**: Dedicated upload endpoint with comprehensive validation

#### Event Slug Implementation
- **New Feature**: Added slug field to Event model for SEO-friendly URLs
- **Auto-generation**: Slugs automatically generated from event titles using Django's slugify
- **Uniqueness**: Automatic handling of duplicate slugs with numbered suffixes
- **Migration**: Successfully migrated existing events with auto-generated slugs
- **Dual Access**: Events now accessible via both UUID and slug for flexibility

### September 23, 2025 - Referral Ranking System Implementation
- **New Feature**: Complete monthly referral ranking system to track clients with highest referral activity
- **Database Schema**: New `ReferralRanking` model tracks monthly statistics for each client
- **API Endpoints**: Three new endpoints for referral analytics:
  - `/api/v1/clients/referral-ranking/` - Historical ranking data with year/month parameters
  - `/api/v1/clients/referral-ranking/current/` - Current month ranking leaderboard  
  - `/api/v1/clients/referral-stats/` - **Public access** general referral statistics (no authentication required)
- **Authentication Changes**: Made referral-stats endpoint public while maintaining authentication for other client endpoints
- **URL Routing Fix**: Resolved URL pattern conflicts by placing specific patterns before router includes
- **Management Command**: `calculate_referral_ranking` command for monthly ranking calculation
- **Admin Interface**: Full Django admin integration with ranking recalculation actions
- **Metrics Tracked**: Reservations by referrals, referral revenue, new referrals made, points earned, ranking position

### September 21, 2025 - Modular Analytics Architecture Implementation
- **Breaking Change**: Replaced monolithic `/stats/` endpoint with specific modular endpoints:
  - `/api/v1/stats/search-tracking/` - Dedicated search analytics with privacy-focused data
  - `/api/v1/stats/ingresos/` - Specific revenue and financial metrics
  - `/api/v1/upcoming-checkins/` - Check-ins analysis and trending dates
- **Security Enhancement**: All analytics endpoints now require authentication (IsAuthenticated)
- **Data Model Corrections**: Fixed field mappings for SearchTracking.search_timestamp and Reservation.price_sol
- **Performance**: Manual nights calculation implemented since Reservation model lacks nights field
- **Privacy**: Maintained IP anonymization and "FirstName L." format for client data
- **Deprecation**: ComprehensiveStatsView marked as deprecated, use specific endpoints instead
